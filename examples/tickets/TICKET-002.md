## Overview

Enable users to subscribe to weekly email digests of platform activity. This epic encompasses the entire workflow from user preference configuration through digest delivery.

## Goals

- Goal 1: Users can opt-in/out of weekly digest emails
- Goal 2: Digest delivery happens reliably every Monday morning at user's preferred time
- Goal 3: Digest content is personalized based on user activity and interests

## Scope

**In Scope**:
- Digest preference UI in user settings
- Digest template and content generation
- Email delivery scheduling and retry logic
- Digest content personalization based on user interactions
- Unsubscribe mechanism

**Out of Scope** (defer to later phases):
- Daily/monthly digest frequencies (start with weekly only)
- Advanced filtering/customization of digest content
- Mobile push notification equivalent
- Digest analytics dashboard

## Success Metrics

- Metric 1: 40% of active users subscribe to digest by end of Q4
- Metric 2: Email delivery success rate > 99%
- Metric 3: Click-through rate on digest links > 5%

## Key Dependencies

- **Requires**: User authentication system (TICKET-001) must be complete
- **Blocks**: Analytics features that depend on user engagement data
- **Integrates with**: Email service provider (SendGrid or similar)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All sub-tickets completed and merged
- [ ] Digest templates created and tested
- [ ] Email delivery achieves 99%+ success rate
- [ ] User preference UI is intuitive and accessible
- [ ] Documentation includes setup and maintenance guides
- [ ] Feature is behind feature flag for gradual rollout

## Open Questions

- [Product] Should digest frequency be configurable per user or fixed weekly?
- [Engineering] What email service provider should we use?
- [Design] What digest layout and styling matches our brand?
- [Product] How should we measure digest engagement (opens, clicks, etc.)?

## Planned Breakdown (Initial)

The following sub-tickets will implement this epic:

1. **Design digest schema** - Database design for digest configuration and history
2. **Implement digest API** - Backend service for digest generation and scheduling
3. **Create digest email templates** - HTML/text templates for digest rendering
4. **Add digest preferences UI** - Frontend UI for users to manage subscriptions
5. **Setup email delivery** - Integration with email service and scheduling
6. **Write integration tests** - E2E tests covering full digest workflow
7. **Documentation** - API and user guides for digest feature

## Notes

This epic is foundational for user engagement and retention. Coordinate closely with the email service provider to ensure deliverability and performance.
