## Context

Users need a secure way to authenticate with the platform. Currently there is no authentication mechanism, which blocks access control and user session management.

- Problem it solves: Enables user registration, login, and session tracking
- User impact: Users can securely access personalized features and data
- Business value: Required for multi-user support and user analytics

## Requirements

**Functional requirements**:
- Support email/password login flow
- Add OAuth2 integration (optional but recommended)
- Implement JWT-based session management
- Support password reset via email
- Support account logout and session cleanup

**Non-functional requirements**:
- Password hashing using bcrypt or similar
- JWT token expiration (15 minutes access, 7 days refresh)
- API response time < 200ms for auth endpoints
- Compatible with both web and mobile clients

**Integration points**:
- User database schema
- Email service for password reset
- Frontend login page and UI components

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given-When-Then Examples

Given a user is on the login page
When they enter valid email/password
Then they receive a JWT token and are authenticated

Given a user submits invalid credentials
When they click login
Then they see an error message and remain on the login page

### Technical Checkboxes

- [ ] POST /auth/register endpoint accepts email + password
- [ ] POST /auth/login endpoint returns JWT access token + refresh token
- [ ] JWT tokens include user ID and expiration timestamp
- [ ] POST /auth/logout endpoint invalidates session
- [ ] Password reset flow sends email with secure link
- [ ] Error handling returns 400 for invalid input, 401 for bad auth
- [ ] API tests cover happy path and error cases
- [ ] Documentation updated with auth API endpoints

## Open Questions

- [Engineering] Should we use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing?
- [Product] Do we need two-factor authentication in Phase 1 or defer to Phase 2?
- [Engineering] What's the token refresh strategy - silent or explicit?
- [Security] What password complexity requirements should we enforce?

## Dependencies

- Depends on: Database schema setup (user table with email/password fields)
- Blocks: User profile management, access control features

## Notes

This is the foundational ticket for user identity. All subsequent user-facing features depend on authentication being complete and stable.
